## What did I learn?
Ultimately, I learned how to use React.js, Redux, and creating a react app as a whole.
There's a whole thought process to it. If you mess up even installing the dependencies, you may mess the entire project and restart again (like I did). 
The good thing is, after restarting, I learned how to sucessfully install and utilize react to create a react app.
I can certainly say that this process of creating a react app can be transferred into different projects. 
Another thing is implementing API's and fetching data from current API's. I've learnt more from React-Redux and I can see
how much of a powerful tool it is in modern web applications.  I also changed a bit of stylings and designs.

Overall, the project was hard to create. There were a lot of things needed to implement, and a lot of code that was 
updated over the years (in React.js). There were so many bugs while testing, and a lot of problems I had to redo. 
Besides that, I've learnt more about cryptocurrencies through the news and even the market (how it works). Do I know how to invest still? Probably not.
